3. 
Hospital outpatient clinic diagnostic service for all costs in excess of $|20 a patient|. 
4. 
Community visiting nurse services at home for up to 240 days an illness|. 
The President noted that Congress last year passed a law providing grants to states to help pay medical bills of the needy aged|. 
CALLS PROPOSAL MODEST 
He said his plan is designed to "|meet the needs of those millions who have no wish to receive care at the taxpayers|' expense|, but who are nevertheless staggered by the drain on their savings -- or those of their children -- caused by an extended hospital stay|"|. 
"|This is a very modest proposal cut to meet absolutely essential needs|"|, he said|, "|and with sufficient '|deductible|` requirements to discourage any malingering or unnecessary overcrowding of our hospitals|. 
"|This is not a program of socialized medicine|. 
It is a program of prepayment of health costs with absolute freedom of choice guaranteed|. 
Every person will choose his own doctor and hospital|"|. 
WOULD|N'T PAY DOCTORS 
The plan does not cover doctor bills|. 
They would still be paid by the patient|. 
Apart from the aged care plan the President|'s most ambitious and costly proposals were for federal scholarships|, and grants to build or enlarge medical and dental schools|. 
The President said the nation|'s 92 medical and 47 dental schools can|not now handle the student load needed to meet the rising need for health care|. 
Moreover|, he said|, many qualified young people are not going into medicine and dentistry because they ca|n't afford the schooling costs|. 
CONTRIBUTIONS TO SCHOOLS 
The scholarship plan would provide federal contributions to each medical and dental school equal to $|1,500 a year for one|-|fourth of the first year students|. 
The schools could use the money to pay 4|-|year scholarships|, based on need|, of up to $|2,000 a year per student|. 
In addition|, the government would pay a $|1,000 "|cost of education|" grant to the schools for each $|1,500 in scholarship grants|. 
Officials estimated the combined programs would cost 5.1 million dollars the first year and would go up to 21 millions by 1966|. 
The President recommended federal "|matching grants|" totaling 700 million dollars in 10 years for constructing new medical and dental schools or enlarging the capacity of existing ones|. 
MORE FOR NURSING HOMES 
In the area of "|community health services|"|, the President called for doubling the present 10 million dollar a year federal grants for nursing home construction|. 
He asked for another 10 million dollar "|initial|" appropriation for "|stimulatory grants|" to states to improve nursing homes|. 
He further proposed grants of an unspecified sum for experimental hospitals|. 
In the child health field|, the President said he will recommend later an increase in funds for programs under the children|'s bureau|. 
He also asked Congress to approve establishment of a national child health institute|. 
ASKS RESEARCH FUNDS 
The President said he will ask Congress to increase grants to states for vocational rehabilitation|. 
He did not say by how much|. 
For medical research he asked a 20 million dollar a year increase|, from 30 to 50 millions|, in matching grants for building research facilities|. 
The President said he will also propose increasing|, by an unspecified amount|, the 540 million dollars in the 1961|-|62 budget for direct government research in medicine|. 
The President said his proposals combine the "|indispensable elements in a sound health program -- people|, knowledge|, services|, facilities|, and the means to pay for them|"|. 
REACTION AS EXPECTED 
Congressional reaction to the message was along expected lines|. 
Legislators who last year opposed placing aged|-|care under the social security system criticized the President|'s plan|. 
Those who backed a similar plan last year hailed the message|. 
Senate Republican Leader Dirksen [|Ill.|] and House Republican Leader Charles Halleck [|Ind.|] said the message did not persuade them to change their opposition to compulsory medical insurance|. 
Halleck said the voluntary care plan enacted last year should be given a fair trial first|. 
House Speaker Sam Rayburn [|D.|, Tex.|] called the Kennedy program "|a mighty fine thing|"|, but made no prediction on its fate in the House|. 
WASHINGTON|, FEB. 9 
-- Acting hastily under White House pressure|, the Senate tonight confirmed Robert C. Weaver as the nation|'s federal housing chief|. 
Only 11 senators were on the floor and there was no record vote|. 
A number of scattered "|ayes|" and "|noes|" was heard|. 
Customary Senate rules were ignored in order to speed approval of the Negro leader as administrator of the housing and home finance agency|. 
In the last eight years|, all Presidential appointments|, including those of cabinet rank|, have been denied immediate action because of a Senate rule requiring at least a 24 hour delay after they are reported to the floor|. 
ENFORCE BY DEMAND 
The rule was enforced by demand of Sen. Wayne Morse [|D.|, Ore.|] in connection with President Eisenhower|'s cabinet selections in 1953 and President Kennedy|'s in 1961|. 
OSLO 
The most positive element to emerge from the Oslo meeting of North Atlantic Treaty Organization Foreign Ministers has been the freer|, franker|, and wider discussions|, animated by much better mutual understanding than in past meetings|. 
This has been a working session of an organization that|, by its very nature|, can only proceed along its route step by step and without dramatic changes|. 
In Oslo|, the ministers have met in a climate of candor|, and made a genuine attempt to get information and understanding one another|'s problems|. 
This atmosphere of understanding has been particularly noticeable where relations are concerned between the "|colonialist|" powers and those who have never|, or not for a long time|, had such problems|. 
The nightmare of a clash between those in trouble in Africa|, exacerbated by the difficulties|, changes|, and tragedies facing them|, and other allies who intellectually and emotionally disapprove of the circumstances that have brought these troubles about|, has been conspicious by its absence|. 
EXPLOSION AVOIDED 
In the case of Portugal|, which a few weeks ago was rumored ready to walk out of the NATO Council should critics of its Angola policy prove harsh|, there has been a noticeable relaxation of tension|. 
The general|, remarkably courteous|, explanation has left basic positions unchanged|, but there has been no explosion in the council|. 
There should even be no more bitter surprises in the UN General Assembly as to NATO members|' votes|, since a new ad hoc NATO committee has been set up so that in the future such topics as Angola will be discussed in advance|. 
Canada alone has been somewhat out of step with the Oslo attempt to get all the allied cars back on the track behind the NATO locomotive|. 
Even Norway|, despite daily but limited manifestations against atomic arms in the heart of this northernmost capital of the alliance|, is today closer to the NATO line|. 
On the negative side of the balance sheet must be set some disappointment that the United States leadership has not been as much in evidence as hoped for|. 
One diplomat described the tenor of Secretary of State Dean Rusk|'s speeches as "|inconclusive|"|. 
But he hastened to add that|, if United States policies were not always clear|, despite Mr. Rusk|'s analysis of the various global danger points and setbacks for the West|, this may merely mean the new administration has not yet firmly fixed its policy|. 
EXPLORATORY MOOD 
A certain vagueness may also be caused by tactical appreciation of the fact that the present council meeting is a semipublic affair|, with no fewer than six Soviet correspondents accredited|. 
The impression has nevertheless been given during these three days|, despite Mr. Rusk|'s personal popularity|, that the United States delegation came to Oslo in a somewhat tentative and exploratory frame of mind|, more ready to listen and learn than to enunciate firm policy on a global scale with detailed application to individual danger spots|. 
The Secretary of State himself|, in his first speech|, gave some idea of the tremendous march of events inside and outside the United States that has preoccupied the new administration in the past four months|. 
But where the core of NATO is concerned|, the Secretary of State has not only reiterated the United States|' profound attachment to the alliance|, "|cornerstone|" of its foreign policy|, but has announced that five nuclear submarines will eventually be at NATO|'s disposal in European waters|. 
The Secretary of State has also solemnly repeated a warning to the Soviet Union that the United States will not stand for another setback in Berlin|, an affirmation once again taken up by the council as a whole|. 
CONFLICT SURVEYED 
The secretary|'s greatest achievement is perhaps the rekindling of NATO realization that East|-|West friction|, wherever it take place around the globe|, is in essence the general conflict between two entirely different societies|, and must be treated as such without regard to geographical distance or lack of apparent connection|. 
The annual spring meeting has given an impetus in three main directions|: more|, deeper|, and more timely political consultation within the alliance|, the use of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (|when ratified|) as a method of coordinating aid to the underdeveloped countries|, and the need for strengthening conventional forces as well as the maintenance of the nuclear deterrent|. 
This increase in the "|threshold|"|, as the conventional forces strengthening is called|, will prove one of the alliance|'s most difficult problems in the months to come|. 
Each ally will have to carry out obligations long since laid down|, but never completely fulfilled|. 
WASHINGTON 
The Kennedy administration moves haltingly toward a Geneva conference on Laos just as serious debate over its foreign policy erupts for the first time|. 
There is little optimism here that the Communists will be any more docile at the conference table than they were in military actions on the ground in Laos|. 
The United States|, State Department officials explain|, now is mainly interested in setting up an international inspection system which will prevent Laos from being used as a base for Communist attacks on neighboring Thailand and South Viet Nam|. 
They count on the aid of the neutral countries attending the Geneva conference to achieve this|. 
The United States hopes that any future Lao Cabinet would not become Communist dominated|. 
But it is apparent that no acceptable formula has been found to prevent such a possibility|. 
POLICIES MODIFIED 
The inclination here is to accept a de facto cease-fire in Laos|, rather than continue to insist on a verification of the cease-fire by the international control commission before participating in the Geneva conference|. 
This is another of the modifications of policy on Laos that the Kennedy administration has felt compelled to make|. 
It excuses these actions as being the chain reaction to basic errors made in the previous administration|. 
Its spokesmen insist that there has not been time enough to institute reforms in military and economic aid policies in the critical areas|. 
But with the months moving on -- and the immediate confrontations with the Communists showing no gain for the free world -- the question arises|: 
How effective have Kennedy administration first foreign policy decisions been in dealing with Communist aggression|? 
Former Vice|-|President Richard M. Nixon in Detroit called for a firmer and tougher policy toward the Soviet Union|. 
He was critical of what he feels is President Kennedy|'s tendency to be too conciliatory|. 
GOP RESTRAINED 
It does not take a Gallup poll to find out that most Republicans in Congress feel this understates the situation as Republicans see it|. 
They can hardly restrain themselves from raising the question of whether Republicans|, if they had been in power|, would have made "|amateurish and monumental blunders|" in Cuba|. 
One Republican senator told this correspondent that he was constantly being asked why he did|n't attack the Kennedy administration on this score|. 
His reply|, he said|, was that he agreed to the need for unity in the country now|. 
But he further said that it was better politics to let others question the wisdom of administration policies first|. 
The Republicans some weeks ago served notice through Senator Thruston B. Morton (|R|) of Kentucky|, chairman of the Republican National Committee|, that the Kennedy administration would be held responsible if the outcome in Laos was a coalition government susceptible of Communist domination|. 
Kennedy administration policies also have been assailed now from another direction by 70 Harvard|, Boston University|, Brandeis|, and Massachusetts Institute of Technology educators|. 
DETENTE URGED 
This group pleads with the administration to "|give no further support for the invasion of Cuba by exile groups|"|. 
It recommends that the United States "|seek instead to detach the Castro regime from the Communist bloc by working for a diplomatic detente and a resumption of trade relations|; and concentrate its constructive efforts on eliminating in other parts of Latin America the social conditions on which totalitarian nationalism feeds|"|. 
Mr. Nixon|, for his part|, would oppose intervention in Cuba without specific provocation|. 
But he did recommend that President Kennedy state clearly that if Communist countries shipped any further arms to Cuba that it would not be tolerated|. 
Until the Cuban fiasco and the Communist military victories in Laos|, almost any observer would have said that President Kennedy had blended a program that respected|, generally|, the opinions voiced both by Mr. Nixon and the professors|. 
AID PLANS REVAMPED 
Very early in his administration he informed the Kremlin through diplomatic channels|, a high official source disclosed|, that the new administration would react even tougher than the Eisenhower administration would during the formative period of the administration|. 
Strenuous efforts were made to remove pin pricking from administration statements|. 
Policies on nuclear test ban negotiations were reviewed and changed|. 
But thus far there has been no response in kind|. 
Foreign aid programs were revamped to give greater emphasis to economic aid and to encourage political reform in recipient nations|. 
In Laos|, the administration looked at the Eisenhower administration efforts to show determination by sailing a naval fleet into Southeast Asian waters as a useless gesture|. 
Again and again it asked the Communists to "|freeze|" the military situation in Laos|. 
But the Communists aided the Pathet Lao at an even faster rate|. 
And after several correspondents went into Pathet Lao territory and exposed the huge build|-|up|, administration spokesmen acclaimed them for performing a "|great service|" and laid the matter before the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization|. 
SEATO was steamed up and prepared contingency plans for coping with the military losses in Laos|. 
But the Communists never gave sufficient provocation at any one time for the United States to want to risk a limited or an all-out war over Laos|. 
(|Some SEATO nations disagreed|, however|. 
) 
There was the further complication that the administration had very early concluded that Laos was ill suited to be an ally|, unlike its more determined neighbors|, Thailand and South Viet Nam|. 
The administration declared itself in favor of a neutralized Laos|. 
The pro|-|Western government|, which the United States had helped in a revolt against the Souvanna Phouma "|neutralist|" government|, never did appear to spark much fighting spirit in the Royal Lao Army|. 
There certainly was not any more energy displayed after it was clear the United States would not back the pro|-|Western government to the hilt|. 
If the administration ever had any ideas that it could find an acceptable alternative to Prince Souvanna Phouma|, whom it felt was too trusting of Communists|, it gradually had to relinquish them|. 
One factor was the statement of Senator J. W. Fulbright (|D|) of Arkansas|, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee|. 
He declared on March 25 that the United States had erred a year and a half ago by "|encouraging the removal|" of Prince Souvanna|. 
WASHINGTON 
The White House is taking extraordinary steps to check the rapid growth of juvenile delinquency in the United States|. 
The President is deeply concerned over this problem and its effect upon the "|vitality of the nation|"|. 
In an important assertion of national leadership in this field|, he has issued an executive order establishing the President|'s committee on Juvenile Delinquency and Crime|, to be supported and assisted by a Citizens Advisory Council of recognized authorities on juvenile problems|. 
The President asks the support and cooperation of Congress in his efforts through the enactment of legislation to provide federal grants to states for specified efforts in combating this disturbing crime trend|. 
OFFENSES MULTIPLY 
The President has also called upon the Attorney General|, the Secretary of Health|, Education and Welfare|, and the Secretary of Labor to coordinate their efforts "|in the development of a program of federal leadership to assist states and local communities in their efforts to cope with the problem|. 
Simultaneously the President announced Thursday the appointment of David L. Hackett|, a special assistant ot the Attorney General|, as executive director of the new Committee on Juvenile Delinquency and Youth Crime|. 
His sense of urgency in this matter stems from the fact that court cases ond juvenile arrests have more than doubled since 1948|, each year showing an increase in offenders|. 
Among arrests reported by the Federal Bureau of Investigation in 1959|, about half for burglary and larceny involved persons under 18 years of age|. 
East Providence should organize its civil defense setup and begin by appointing a full|-|time director|, Raymond H. Hawksley|, the present city CD head|, believes|. 
Mr. Hawksley said yesterday he would be willing to go before the city council "|or anyone else locally|" to outline his proposal at the earliest possible time|. 
East Providence now has no civil defense program|. 
Mr. Hawksley|, the state|'s general treasurer|, has been a part|-|time CD director in the city for the last nine years|. 
He is not interested in being named a full|-|time director|. 
Noting that President Kennedy has handed the Defense Department the major responsibility for the nation|'s civil defense program|, Mr. Hawksley said the federal government would pay half the salary of a full|-|time local director|. 
He expressed the opinion the city could hire a CD director for about $|3,500 a year and would only have to put up half that amount on a matching fund basis to defray the salary costs|. 
Mr. Hawksley said he believed there are a number of qualified city residents who would be willing to take the full|-|time CD job|. 
One of these men is former Fire Chief John A. Laughlin|, he said|. 
Along with a director|, the city should provide a CD headquarters so that pertinent information about the local organization would be centralized|. Mr. Hawksley said|. 
One advantage that would come to the city in having a full|-|time director|, he said|, is that East Providence would become eligible to apply to the federal government for financial aid in purchasing equipment needed for a sound civil defense program|. 
Matching funds also can be obtained for procurement of such items as radios|, sirens and rescue trucks|, he said|. 
Mr. Hawksley believes that East Providence could use two more rescue trucks|, similar to the CD vehicle obtained several years ago and now detailed to the Central Fire Station|. 
He would assign one of the rescue trucks to the Riverside section of the city and the other to the Rumford area|. 
Speaking of the present status of civil defense in the city|, Mr. Hawksley said he would be willing to bet that not more than one person in a hundred would know what to do or where to go in the event of an enemy attack|. 
The Narragansett Race Track grounds is one assembly point|, he said|, and a drive|-|in theater in Seekonk would be another|. 
Riverside residents would go to the Seekonk assembly point|. 
Mr. Hawksley said he was not critical of city residents for not knowing what to do or where to assemble in case of an air attack|. 
Such vital information|, he said|, has to be made available to the public frequently and at regular intervals for residents to know|. 
If the city council fails to consider appointment of a full|-|time CD director|, Mr. Hawksley said|, then he plans to call a meeting early in September so that a civil defense organization will be developed locally|. 
One of the first things he would do|, he said|, would be to organize classes in first aid|. 
Other steps would be developed after information drifts down to the local level from the federal government|. 
Rhode Island is going to examine its Sunday sales law with possible revisions in mind|. 
Governor Notte said last night he plans to name a committee to make the study and come up with recommendations for possible changes in time for the next session of the General Assembly|. 
The governor|'s move into the so-called "|blue law|" controversy came in the form of a letter to Miss Mary R. Grant|, deputy city clerk of Central Falls|. 
A copy was released to the press|. 
Mr. Notte was responding to a resolution adopted by the Central Falls City Council on July 10 and sent to the state house by Miss Grant|. 
The resolution urges the governor to have a complete study of the Sunday sales laws made with an eye to their revision at the next session of the legislature|. 
While the city council suggested that the Legislative Council might perform the review|, Mr. Notte said that instead he will take up the matter with Atty. Gen. J. Joseph Nugent to get "|the benefit of his views|"|. 
He will then appoint the study committee with Mr. Nugent|'s cooperation|, the governor said|. 
"|I would expect the proposed committee to hold public hearings|"|, Mr. Notte said|, "|to obtain the views of the general public and religious|, labor and special|-|interest groups affected by these laws|"|. 
The governor wrote Miss Grant that he has been concerned for some time "|with the continuous problem which confronts our local and state law enforcement officers as a result of the laws regulating Sunday sales|"|. 
The attorney general has advised local police that it is their duty to enforce the blue laws|. 
Should there be evidence they are shirking|, he has said|, the state police will step into the situation|. 
There has been more activity across the state line in Massachusetts than in Rhode Island in recent weeks toward enforcement of the Sunday sales laws|. 
The statutes|, similar in both the Bay State and Rhode Island and dating back in some instances to colonial times|, severely limit the types of merchandise that may be sold on the Sabbath|. 
The Central Falls City Council expressed concern especially that more foods be placed on the eligible list and that neighborhood grocery and variety stores be allowed to do business on Sunday|. 
The only day they "|have a chance to compete with large supermarkets is on Sunday|"|, the council|'s resolution said|. 
The small shops "|must be retained|, for they provide essential service to the community|"|, according to the resolution|, which added that they "|also are the source of livelihood for thousands of our neighbors|"|. 
It declares that Sunday sales licenses provide "|great revenue|" to the local government|. 
The council advised the governor that "|large supermarkets|, factory outlets and department stores not be allowed to do business|" on Sunday|. 
They "|operate on a volume basis|"|, it was contended|, "|and are not essential to provide the more limited but vital shopping needs of the community|"|. 
Liberals and conservatives in both parties -- Democratic and Republican -- should divorce themselves and form two independent parties|, George H. Reama|, nationally known labor|-|management expert|, said here yesterday|. 
Mr. Reama told the Rotary Club of Providence at its luncheon at the Sheraton|-|Biltmore Hotel that about half of the people in the country want the "|welfare|" type of government and the other half want a free enterprise system|. 
He suggested that a regrouping of forces might allow the average voter a better pull at the right lever for him on election day|. 
He said he was "|confessing that I was a member of the Socialist Party in 1910|"|. 
That|, he added|, was when he was "|a very young man|, a machinist and toolmaker by trade|. 
"|That was before I studied law|. 
Some of my fellow workers were grooming me for an office in the Socialist Party|. 
The lawyer with whom I studied law steered me off the Socialist track|. 
He steered me to the right track -- the free enterprise track|"|. 
He said that when he was a Socialist in 1910|, the party called for government operation of all utilities and the pooling of all resources|. 
He suggested that without the Socialist Party ever gaining a national victory|, most of its original program has come to pass under both major parties|. 
Mr. Reama|, who retired as vice president of the American Screw Co. in 1955 said|, "|Both parties in the last election told us that we need a five per cent growth in the gross national product -- but neither told us how to achieve it|"|. 
He said he favors wage increases for workers -- "|but manufacturers are caught in a profit squeeze|" -- and raises should only come when the public is conditioned to higher prices|, he added|. 
Indicating the way in which he has turned his back on his 1910 philosophy|, Mr. Reama said|: "|A Socialist is a person who believes in dividing everything he does not own|"|. 
Mr. Reama|, far from really being retired|, is engaged in industrial relations counseling|. 
A petition bearing the signatures of more than 1,700 Johnston taxpayers was presented to the town council last night as what is hoped will be the first step in obtaining a home rule charter for the town|. 
William A. Martinelli|, chairman of the Citizens Group of Johnston|, transferred the petitions from his left hand to his right hand after the council voted to accept them at the suggestion of Council President Raymond Fortin Sr|. 
The law which governs home rule charter petitions states that they must be referred to the chairman of the board of canvassers for verification of the signatures within 10 days and Mr. Martinelli happens to hold that post|. 
Mr. Martinelli explained that there should be more than enough signatures to assure the scheduling of a vote on the home rule charter and possible election of a nine member charter commission within 70 days|. 
He explained that by law the council must establish procedures for a vote on the issue within 60 days after the board of canvassers completes its work|. 
A difference of opinion arose between Mr. Martinelli and John P. Bourcier|, town solicitor|, over the exact manner in which the vote is handled|. 
Mr. Martinelli has|, in recent weeks|, been of the opinion that a special town meeting would be called for the vote|, while Mr. Bourcier said that a special election might be called instead|.
